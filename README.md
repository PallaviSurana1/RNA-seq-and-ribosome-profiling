#### RNA-seq-and-ribosome-profiling
Ribo-seq is a specific form of RNA-gene expression which takes into account the messenger RNAs bound to ribosomes.
This script is a starter script in Command line. 

It is a next-gen sequencing technique developed by Nicholas Ingolia and Jonathan Weissman. 
This technique aids the underdstanding in translation regulation.
